**The modern, open-source writing studio for authors.**

Storyteller is a powerful desktop application designed to replace the outdated interfaces of traditional writing software. It combines the distraction-free environment of a simple text editor with the complex world-building tools needed for full-length novels and series.

Built for the modern web era, it prioritizes user experience (UI/UX), speed, and complete customizability.
